# AIC – MVP Scope

This document defines the explicit scope of the AIC MVP.

The goal of the MVP is **not completeness**, but to validate that AI-assisted
incident correlation can materially reduce time-to-root-cause.

---

## MVP Goals

- Reduce cognitive load during incidents
- Surface plausible root-cause hypotheses faster
- Assist junior and senior engineers alike
- Operate fully on-prem

---

## Included in MVP

- Log ingestion (structured + semi-structured)
- Metric ingestion (basic time-series)
- Deployment/change event ingestion
- Incident-scoped correlation
- Root-cause hypothesis generation
- Read-only remediation guidance

---

## Explicitly Excluded from MVP

- Auto-remediation
- Long-term learning across customers
- Cross-incident knowledge sharing
- SaaS or hosted offering
- Cost optimization features

---

## Success Criteria

- Engineers can explain *why* an incident occurred faster than baseline
- Hypotheses are actionable, not generic
- System remains usable during partial outages
